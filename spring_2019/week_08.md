## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I plan to work on the post settings in the app. The post option allows for users to create a post where they list out the destination they want to go to, the time they want to leave, the number of passengers they have to fill, and any other future comments. Right now, I am planning to work with John Hong on creating a drop down menu to list out the avaliable times users can input. We don't really have any experience working with drop down menus, so we will be googling how to implement it and just trying out different things. The problem is we will be working with fragments, and there are always complications with implementing with fragments due to the nature of Android Studio. So there will be some errors we will run into.


Last week, I just started researching how to do the drop-down menu but haven't had any success thus far. But, I have been working on the slides instead of working on the app itself.


## This Week's Plan
This week, I am caught up on working on the slides for the project. Since I am the Android group leader, I am responsible for working on the slides and making sure we have the adequate information on the slides. I am also responsible for working on the demo. Me and Zach have been discussing whether or not to do the demo beacuse of time constraints. So we might just take screenshots of our app and put it onto the slides. I will be postponing work on the Android studio this week to work on the slides and just practicing what I have to say.



## Anything Blocking?
