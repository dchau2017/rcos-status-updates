## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week was spring break so I did not do any work related to RCOS.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan on working on some loose ends that I failed to account for last time. For example, I plan to work on adding a Hub button on the menu so that users can go back to hub after clicking on a button in the menu. Also, I need to implement a functional log out button that returns user to the log in screen.

## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge in Android Studio and Java and homework assignments that take up some time.
