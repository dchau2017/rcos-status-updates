## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I completed the add friends page within Android studio. Since there is no back-end, I just implemented the front-end of the page. Basically, I added a text box for users to enter a RPI email for them to send a request to another user. Then, I added a button for users to submit the request. At the bottom of the page, I have a display to show users all of their pending friend requests and they can accept or reject them.



## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to finish implementing the rest of the pages within the settings tab/menu, this includes things like Privacy Settings, Security Settings, Manage Notifications, etc. It will be very similar to what I did last week in terms of implementing the front end of these pages. I do have an algo test this week, so I might not be able to do as much as again. 



## Anything Blocking?
I have an algorthims test this week so I will not have as much time to do the regular amount of work I do. But I will still continue to work hard.
