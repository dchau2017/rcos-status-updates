## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I finished up brushing up on loose ends on the Android app. One thing I did last week was I added the return to hub button on the sliding menu. I was able to acomplish this by reusing some old code I had from the login page that directed users from login to the hub and used that function/code to redirect users from the settings page back to the hub. I also used the old code to implement the logout page which takes the user from the hub/menu and uses the same old code to redirect users back to the login page.

## This Week's Plan
This week, I am still contuning to work on Android even though many of the other Android group members have transitioned to the web app. This week, I am planning to finish implmenting the Add friends page so users can add in a RPI email and send a request. There is no backend, so we can't actually send requests but we can still do the front-end.


## Anything Blocking?
I have some frisbee tournament this weekend so I will not have alot of time.
