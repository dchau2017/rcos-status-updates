## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I was mainly focused on making slides for the presentation. I collabarated with Zach and John to spell out exaclty what I need to say. We got screenshots for the app highlighting the login screen, the slide out menu, the create post, the hub, the logout page, etc. I felt the presentation went well since we fit in the alloated time and the powerpoint looked good by spliting the slides with too much text and adding pictures.


## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to continue working with John Hong on creating the drop down menu and finishing up the post section. We finished adding text box's for users to input where they want to go, a comments section. We want to implement a drop down menu for users to list out the possible times for users to leave at. We spent alot of time researching possible implementations on how to implement the drop down menu. The problem with alot of them was that they conflicted with the current fragment model we have within Android studio. We finally stumbled upon a barebones solution which was compatible with our fragment model. We managed to implement it and we now have a functional drop-down menu to list out the possible times. We don't have a back-end set up so we can't store the posts.



## Anything Blocking?
