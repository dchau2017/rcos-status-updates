## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last weekm I worked with John Hong on creating the drop down menu and finishing up the post section. We added all the test boxes for users to input information to form a post about where they want to go, what time they want to leave, and the #of passengers they want. Furthermore, I also starting working on the edit profile fragment where users can upload their profile picture, change their name, change their username, etc. 



## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to keep working on the edit profile fragment. So far, I have put an upload new profile picture button within the edit profile fragment. So far it does not redirect anywhere, but in the future I plan to have it redirect to another page where users can select a photo from their phone as a new picture. I have also added text fields where users can type in a new name or email to change their contact information. I am also thinking of implementing a common places/hometown field so other users can know the common places you go and can contact you about potenitally sharing rides. This information would be dispayed as a scroll-down menu where other users can click on your profile and look at all the common places you use GroupRide for and ask about sharing a ride. I have already down and commited most of these features and I will be trying to do work for the project this week but I have finals to study for and will not be here over the weekend so I will try my best to get as much done as possible.



## Anything Blocking?
Finals, other club commitments
