## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I was very sick and had two tests so I was unable to accomplish my task.


## This Week's Plan
This week, my plan is to fix a bug which is that the menu button isn't showing up
after merging some of Kevin's changes. So I will probably spend some time Googling that 
and finding out what the error is. Also, my next issue is to set up the firebase database
for Android and connect to the login screen. 


## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge with Firebase and time to google the error and see what the bug is.
