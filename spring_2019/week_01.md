## Last Week's Accomplishments
Lsat week, I was able to link the main login page to the Hub for the Android RPI Group Ride app. Then entailed going into the login page code and redirecting the user after they entered the correct username and password into the Hub instead of a dummy page I created earlier as a placeholder. 


## This Week's Plan
This week, I will be creating a slide out settings menu. Basically, the user presses a button in the Hub and a settings slide out menu slides out from the left with various options for settings. I have completed most of it after spending hours looking up tutorials and videos on how to create this in Android Studio. The only features I have left to implement is a button to get back to the hub and configure the log out page to go back to the Hub.



## Anything Blocking?
I have lots of test and assignments this week so I probably won't be able to finish it until the weekend. I also have to google how to do it since I am not sure how to do it in Android Studio.
