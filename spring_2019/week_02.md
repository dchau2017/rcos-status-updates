## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I finsihed the pretty slide out menu for the Android app. 


## This Week's Plan
This week, my plan is to fix a bug which is that the menu button isn't showing up
after merging some of Kevin's changes. So I will probably spend some time Googling that 
and finding out what the error is.


## Anything Blocking?
I am very sick this week and have 2 tests so I probably will not be able to do anything.
