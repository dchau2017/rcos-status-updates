## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I plan to finish implementing the rest of the pages within the settings tab/menu, this includes things like Privacy Settings, Security Settings, Manage Notifications, etc. It will be very similar to what I did last week in terms of implementing the front end of these pages. I do have an algo test this week, so I might not be able to do as much as again. 




## This Week's Plan
This week, I plan to work on the post settings in the app. The post option allows for users to create a post where they list out the destination they want to go to, the time they want to leave, the number of passengers they have to fill, and any other future comments. Right now, I am planning to work with John Hong on creating a drop down menu to list out the avaliable times users can input. We don't really have any experience working with drop down menus, so we will be googling how to implement it and just trying out different things. The problem is we will be working with fragments, and there are always complications with implementing with fragments due to the nature of Android Studio. So there will be some errors we will run into.



## Anything Blocking?
Not really
