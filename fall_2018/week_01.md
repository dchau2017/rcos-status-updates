## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week, I spent most of my time setting up my enviorment so I could begin to code. I initally tried installing everything via the WSL bash shell which did not work out to well.
I then installed linux on my laptop which made setting up my enviorment alot easier.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I will be figuring out what I will be doing and hopefully begin tackling some of the issues with Observatory. I plan to begin learning Javascript, Vue.js, Mongodb, etc
so I can begin helping the team. 

## Anything Blocking?

I don't have too much experience working with Javascript, Vue.js, Mongodb so I expect that to block my ability to solve some issues. But hopefully with the support of everyone
else on the team I can learn alot and begin contributing. We also haven't began assigning tasks to anyone yet but that is in the works and assignments should be handed out shortly.
