## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I finshed making the controller file for the user registraiton model. I was then assigned my next issue which was to implement a User Registration form so the admins can keep track of what users there are each semester and what their needs are. I was able to finish this task this week


## This Week's Plan
This week I finished up making the User Registration form and now I am waiting for my next issue.


## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge of Javascript, waiting for the next issue, and the excessive workload of RPI.
