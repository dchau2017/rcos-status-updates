## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I finished my first issue which was completing the URP Form model so that RCOS admins can process URP forms automatically vs manually. We did not have a small group meeting so nothing immediate was assigned to my group.


## This Week's Plan
This week I plan on getting familar with the code base so I can tackle my next issue when it is assigned to me.


## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge of Javascript and just waiting for the next issue.
