## Last Week's Accomplishments
Lsat week, I was swamped with tests and homework assignments so I was unable to work on my assignment of creating the Execused Absence Page. 


## This Week's Plan
This week, I am planning to work on the excused absence page that I was supposed to work on last time. I don't have much experience working on the front end with Vue so I plan on learning some basic Vue and reading some of the old code to learn how to develop the form. Alex led me in the right direction last week by teaching me how to run the server/database and told me to use the Status Update Form as a model to work with. 



## Anything Blocking?
Just time as I have alot of projects due this week and learning Vue.js.
