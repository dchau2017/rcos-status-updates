## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I made the API routes for the user registration model. I initally submitted it, but then there was an error that Alex noticed which I then proceeded to fixed. 


## This Week's Plan
This week I was assigned my next issue which was to make the controller file for the user registration model. I plan to work on it over the week but it may be difficult as I have alot of tests next week.


## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge of Javascript and the excessive workload of RPI.
