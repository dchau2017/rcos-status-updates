## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I switched to working on the front end and began working on making a User Registration form so that RCOS members could register themselves for a semester of RCOS so that the admins could keep track of who is active and who isn't. I'm not too experienced working on the front end so I spent most of my time learning Javascript,Vue, HTML, and Mongo from Alex as he walked me through the basics. 


## This Week's Plan
This week I plan to continue learning Javascript so that I can keep contributing. I am also waiting for my next assignment. 



## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge of Javascript, waiting for the next issue, and the excessive workload of RPI.
