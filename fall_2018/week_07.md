## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I finished making the User Registration routes for the user registration model. I also started working on my next issue which is making the controller file for the user registration model. 


## This Week's Plan
This week I finished my next issue which was to make the controller file for the user registration model. I am waiting to be assigned my next issue and will be working on that.


## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge of Javascript, waiting for the next issue, and the excessive workload of RPI.
