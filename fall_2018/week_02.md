## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week, I finished setting up my enviorment and I got my first assignment which is to create a URP Form model. 



## This Week's Plan
This week I plan on tackling my first issue which is creating an URP model. I was able to acomplish this goal with the help of Charlie. I will be waiting for the next issue and will be working on that.


## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge of Javascript and just waiting for the next issue.
