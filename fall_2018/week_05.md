## Last Week's Accomplishments
Last week I was able to make a team model which is a model that outlines what a team is. A team are a group of people working on a project for a certain semester. I was able to implement it, but I made some errors so I plan on fixing it this week.


## This Week's Plan
This week I'm waiting for some more issues to solve. I also plan on fixing my team model which I made some errors on last time.


## Anything Blocking?
My lack of knowledge of Javascript and just waiting for the next issue.
